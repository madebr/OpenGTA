***************************************************************************
The file formats of the data files are described in documentation released
by DMA Design; this software would not exist without it.

It is my understanding that this documentation was meant for fans of the
original game, thus I cannot place the implementing code under a free
license.
This restriction only applies to a few of the code files (marked as such).
