* fixes for win32 build

* updated bugs, documentation, build system
* preparing to change key input handling

2007-05-30  skyb

* added WGL swap interval feature
* spriteplayer: try anim feature; updated docs
* luaviewer: read config file
* experimental parts of in-game gui
* playing around with basic ped ai
* environment variable influences language file
* updated docs; added author of code fragment to license

2007-05-17  skyb

* derived EntityController registers state change
* rotation fixes
* fixes concerning weapons + moving
* car deltas: damage, doors, lights
* more about "shooting" (hit, damage, explode cars);
col-det tries to find angle for peds (still always the same anim)
* fix: choose correct sprType for non-CAR types (bike, bus, train)
* gui: drawing a string right-to-left
* Map::BlockInfo partial setXXX() functionality
* choose fxt language file (not hardcoded to english anymore)
* 'viewer' screen-gamma in game
* updated usage & version info
* code cleanup

2007-04-30  skyb

* updated bugs list; fixed image links
* vsync options: none, sdl, glx
* uses anisotropic texture filtering if extension is supported
* viewer config options for above (and mipmap & scale2x)
* playing around with car-data
* cars block ped movement

2007-04-25  skyb

A number of helpers:
* project housekeeping
* data dumper tool for cars
* fxt <-> txt converter (txt -> fxt partially working)
* build_svg_rect: visually verify Rectangle operations
* raw_image: generate information about gui 2d art

* projectile-wall collisions should now work on all tiles; minus: z-info,
non-blocking ids
* test code for block-type; minimap nows exports several bmps, viewer
shows colored lines

2007-04-23  skyb

* main feature: projectile hits walls; flat case not working correctly
* (partially?) fixed the triangle-slope texture bug; top/bottom sides?
* gui.h/cpp is included, moved code into image_loader for reuse

fix: allowing 24 bit color depth

really unimportant fixes

contains the code release date; may not be accurate in cvs but will serve
as a kind of version-number for actual releases.

removing dependency on unused code

* feature: animated block textures
* switching from GL matrix to calculations for obj position
* collision: projectile + pedestrian
* unique id generator
* other helpers (not really used so far)

2007-04-12  skyb

Fixes, cleanup and new helpers... little new features:
* prototype sounds: play fx, play music
* many peds on map, running randomly around player

2007-02-25  skyb

* screen: try to guess color depth from bpp
(fixes hang on < 32 bit x11 displays)
* missing code from last commit

fix: lookup now gets level number; should work for all gta1 maps

* build script should detect if SDL_GL_SWAP_CONTROL is defined (by SDL
>= 1.2.10)
* sdl_init & videomode: check for errors

* sector name from message db
* initial projectile support
* minor game_object updates

2007-02-17  skyb

* abstract_container: return (reference to copy of) added T
* enable weapons selection/animation
* more screen config options
* gui-object cleanup
* file_helper: load vfs into mem (for Lua)
* spriteplayer: update to new version (compiles again) + camera hack
(gravity doubles
as y-scroll switch)
* build-system: config.h instead of -D defines; related changes
* coldet/opensteer in license.txt

2007-02-16  skyb

* each explosion plays once and gets removed
* FIXME: at high framerates there is a visible delay when the textures
aren't loaded

* rewrote spritemanager & game objects
* some other fixes
* assorted helpers; sometimes even with testcase, generally not used at
this time

A first halfway working version; some older features are broken,
it may even compile (right now).
