= What happens when you call 'make' =

The main makefile checks the env-variable 'HOST'; 
which is assumed to be "LINUX" or "WIN32", the latter actually being
used to indicate cross-compiling using a mingw-toolchain.

The main makefile checks if the 'Loki'-library is already there;
if not 'wget's it and calls loki.make(.w32_cross) to build it.

It then looks for a file named src_list.make; if that does not exist
it calls "prepare_build.sh $HOST" which generates both src_list.make
and config.h.

The script will only work on Linux where it will use pkg-config to
find the libraries; I hardcoded many Win32 values pointing to my
toolchain and library pathes.

Make now includes src_list.make and builds the default targets;
there are more programs that can be build with an explicit
"make $program_name"; look at src_list.make.

If you need to setup compiler/library paths src_list.make is the
place to do it. Then run make again.


= Features in config.h =

DO_SCALE2X
Enable scale2x algorithm; so far only used for sprites, on if enabled.

HAVE_SDL_VSYNC
Does the SDL header define SDL_GL_SWAP_CONTROL? Must be #undef-ined if
not, may be undefined anyway (turn feature off) and it really depends 
whether the driver supports it (at runtime).

In the future a number of WITH_* defines will be used to enable
support for library-dependent features (Lua, SDL_sound + SDL_mixer,
SDL_image). For the moment only the Lua related flag changes 'viewer',
the other features are only used in testcases.

DEFAULT_SCREEN_WIDTH, DEFAULT_SCREEN_HEIGHT
The initial screen size (unless otherwise defined); defaults to 640x480
if not defined.

DEFAULT_SCREEN_VSYNC
Default setting for vsync;can be one of 0, 1, 2

On Linux you can colorify the log-output by defining LOG_USE_ANSI_COLORS.

= If you modify the code yourself =

Note: the dependency system is somewhat broken, sometimes changes in
header files are ignored; either "make clean" or "touch config.h".
