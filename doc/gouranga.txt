i emailed you all this but am posting it here just-in-case: 
 
hi, i declare myself an expert on gta1 and gta2 map format, i can help you with anything you ask, email me at jernejcoder@gmail.com, let's get straight to answers: 

* Can anyone tell me more about the height/size of blocks as drawn in-game? Currently I texture a unit-cube, but that doesn't look right (may have other causes).

one gta cube is 1*1*1 unit big

* When looking at the "slope type" bits in "type_map" (CDS.DOC) I am not sure howto interpret something like "1- 2 = up 26 low, high"; is it 26 degrees, pixel or another unit?

use it like this: 
 
* 1- 2 = up 26 low, high
* 3 - 4 = down 26 low, high
* 5 - 6 = left 26 low, high
* 7 - 8 = right 26 low, high

* 9 - 16 = up 7 low - high
* 17 - 24 = down 7 low - high
* 25 - 32 = left 7 low - high
* 33 - 40 = right 7 low - high

* 41 - 44 = 45 up,down,left,right

there are 3 types of slopes in gta1, (90°, 45° and 7°) all change level for just one cube.
take parts 1 and 2, these when used together make a pass from lower to upper level over 2 cubes, cube 1 is lower and cube 2 is upper part for this.

* Concerning the FON files; the GTA hacking handbook (http://gta.mendelsohn.de/Reference/Fil_index.html) seems to define them, but the link is broken; the older (zip) version doesn't contain that file. Is that fileformat documented somewhere?

this is very easy format: 
 
Quote:


type
TFon_file_header = packed record
NumPics:byte;
height:Byte;
end;

type
TFon_image_header = packed record
width:byte;
end;

the file starts with TFon_file_header which tells you num pics and all pictures height

then for NumPics there are repeatitous data for characters starting with TFon_image_header that tells you character width, following that you get charwidth * fontheight of 8 bit bitmap data. 

last 768 bytes in a file is palette (RGB format)




i have sound format as well: 

Quote:


grand theft auto .sdt format 
this file is copyright 2002 Delfi delfi@volja.net 
data types are named as used in borland delphi's object pascal language 
 
warning! 
this is for GTA1 and GTA:L only
gta2 and gta3 use different format... 
 
sdt files contains info for raw sound data files with same name but raw extension
 
divide size of sdt file by 12 to get number of sound records
each record contains information on how to use raw file
 
here is delphi packed record: 
 
Tsoundentry = packed record
rawstart: longword;
rawsize: longword;
samplerate: longword;
end;
 
you can export sound like this: 
 
make new empty file and write wav file header: 
 
TWave_data = packed record
  ChunkID: array[0..3] of char;     // 'RIFF' text
  ChunkSize: Longword;
  Format: array[0..3] of char;      // 'WAVE' text
  Subchunk1ID: array[0..3] of char; // 'fmt ' text
  Subchunk1Size: Longword;
  AudioFormat: Word;
  NumChannels: Word;
  SampleRate: Longword;
  ByteRate: Longword;
  BlockAlign: Word;
  BitsPerSample: Word;
  Subchunk2ID: array[0..3] of char; // 'data' text
  Subchunk2Size: Longword;
end;
 
set info in header
 
Wave_data.ChunkID := 'RIFF';
Wave_data.ChunkSize:= 49188;
Wave_data.Format:= 'WAVE';
Wave_data.Subchunk1ID:= 'fmt ';
Wave_data.Subchunk1Size:= 16;
Wave_data.AudioFormat:= 1;
Wave_data.NumChannels:= 1;
Wave_data.SampleRate:= sample rate of entry
Wave_data.BitsPerSample:=8;
Wave_data.ByteRate:= sample rate of entry
Wave_data.BlockAlign:=1; 
Wave_data.Subchunk2ID:= 'data';
Wave_data.Subchunk2Size:= raw data size 
 
now copy raw data and write it after this header 
if you did everything correct you will be able to play wav file with any program... 
 
something interesting from GTA Wave gta sound editor readme file: 
In GTA, all the sounds are in 8-bit mono format, except for those in
LEVEL000. The sounds in this file are 16-bit, the first three being
stereo.



should this be all for now, i have slope cubes in a 3d format representation if you want, email me at jernejcoder@gmail.com  or MSN - stdcall@gmail.com (messenger only) 
 
i'm onto a similar project, a gta1 / gta2 clone project, but gta formats are too limiting for me, and i went onto coding my own gta game clone, you can get screenshoots & demo http://gtatools.com/tdc/, it is written with opengl and delphi 4, i've gotten rendering pretty much perfect, and made my own map and sprite editor, but won't be compatible with gta file formats, but converters can be easily done, here is a picture:
