thats weird, since i can run both topdown j25 and 3D beta j25 just
fine, only M1win doesn't work (on xp) for some reason. i sent you old
M1 for DOS in the pack i sent you the url to.

some of your side tiles are rotated, there is no side rotation, sides
only have a bit flag which means "mirror" - no rotations.

cds says about side tiles that bit 5 and 6 in type_map_ext contain the
mirroring:
bit 5 means that textures on north and south sides should be mirrored,
bit 6 indicates same for east and west side of that cube.

the pal_index reindexes virtual palette numbers into actual - physical
palette numbers.

it works like this:

you take tile palette index, you add palette_index

for sprites for example you need to skip clut dedicated to tiles:
pal_index = (g24_header.tileclut_size div 1024)+ activesprite.clut;

for tiles it is just simple, but remember - if it is lid you need to
add side tiles to the number (and side tiles + lid tiles for animation
/ aux tiles):
pal_index[tile number]

please_see_attached_illustration which also shows the palclut visualized :)

In the nyc i can clearly see you are rotating side tiles, where they
shouldn't be, side tiles are never rotated in gta1 (they are in gta2)
in gta1 they just have mirroring flag in type_map_ext.

and i am seeing this right? - the san andreas map on screenshoot -
unless you rotated the camera itself, should be rotated 180° left (i
know how it shouls look, since i drawn entire san andreas map layout
in mspaint with alt + tabbing 7 years ago ;) ).

this looks quite right, but it appears lid rotation is wrong in blocks
where the type_map_ext mirror flags are used.

i have a delphi project written in pascal, which can render all tiles
from g24 files, i can send you whole source code for it, it may help
you understand how g24 files work :)

thats all for now,  and enjoy your vacations! :)
