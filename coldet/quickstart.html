Quickstart:</h1></center>

<h3>
Model Setup:</h3>
For each mesh, create a collision model by using:
<pre>CollisionModel3D* model = newCollisionModel3D();</pre>
(Shared meshes can use one model)
<br>Add all the triangles the mesh has to the model by using:
<pre>model->addTriangle(vertex1,vertex2,vertex3);</pre>
Call:
<pre>model->finalize();</pre>
&nbsp;
<h3>
Collision Test:</h3>
Assuming you have two models (m1,m2), either set both of their’s transformation
<br>matrices (world matrix) by calling:
<pre>m1->setTransform(model1_transformation_matrix);</pre>

<pre>m2->setTransform(model2_transformation_matrix);</pre>
or set only one of them (in case you’re testing the model against itself,
with different
<br>transform) Then call:
<pre>m1->collision(m2);</pre>
The function returns a bool indicating if a collision has occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note that if you test a
<br>model against itself with a different transform, you need to supply
that transform as an
<br>optional parameter.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Collision Test Results:</h3>
Use the getCollidingTriangles function to get which triangles have collided.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Use the
<br>getCollisionPoint function to find the exact collision point.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Other Collision Tests:</h3>
You can use the rayCollision and sphereCollision functions to test the
model against
<br>these primitives.
